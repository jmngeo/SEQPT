A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve this mission, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.\n\n\n\n\nFor a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.\n\n\n\n\nA few examples of your responsibilities:\n\n * Investigate. Learn everything you can about your product, its business model, and what drives its growth. Once you know the numbers inside out, survey your users and discover what they need. Then challenge the status quo to exceed their expectations.\n * Innovate. Tap into user requests, market trends, and emerging technologies. Think from first principles, and assess which efforts have the highest potential to unlock significant value. Leverage your creative insights to design cutting-edge features and products.\n * Execute. Translate your ideas into high-impact features. Prioritize ruthlessly, analyzing the data to make sure you focus only on what truly moves the needle. Push product designers, engineers, and other team members to do the same.\n * Iterate. Use A/B testing and performance metrics to understand what worked and what didn’t. Treat every project as a learning opportunity. Use past mistakes to fuel your future success.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we look for\n\n * Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.\n * Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high and rising bar.\n * Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.\n * Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we offer\n\n * Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.\n * An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.\n * Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £118,964 and £155,001 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.\n * All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.\n\n\n\n\nCommitment & contract\n\nPermanent or fixed-term. Full-time.\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\nMilan (Italy) or remote.\n\n\n\n\nBefore you apply\n\nBending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.\n\n\n\n\nThe selection process\n\nIf you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.\n\n\n\n\nBending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.\n\n\n\n\nStudies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.",

The idea of Jodel started, when we realised that despite countless products in tech, there was no fast and simple way to connect with people around us.\n\nYou will be able to fully explore the city you live in, listen in on all its vibrant communities and connect with your peers. No matter if it’s other pet lovers nearby or the local techno crowd: Jodel allows you to share memes and jokes, get news, ask questions and simply have fun. You can discuss everything from new hypes to modern-dating, organize help for social causes. And by doing all that you might even get to know new amazing people in your area.\n\nJodel will be closing the gap to easily share a togetherness with all the people you see in the physical world. As this works in your hometown, so it does when moving somewhere else. Whenever you’re travelling, you can be certain there are people around you that wonder about the same things. Is it still worth it to go to the Full Moon party here in Ko Pha-ngan or what are the best tricks for negotiations on the Marrakech market? And maybe, one day, you think about moving to New York so you teleport to its local feed and explore.\n\nCome as you are!\n\nAt Jodel everyone is welcome, regardless of gender identity, nationality, age, disability status, sexual orientation or religion. Jodel is an equal opportunity employer and believes that a great working environment reflects a diversity of backgrounds, experience, talent and thoughts. We will not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on any of these characteristics. All you need is a passion for local communities and a desire to be part of a fast growing startup.",
