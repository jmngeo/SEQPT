  "description": "Description\n\nAWS is set to introduce the inaugural European Sovereign Cloud (ESC), marking a significant development in utility computing (UC). To spearhead this initiative, we are actively seeking experienced systems engineers with a strong background in automation and operations. As part of the AWS Managed Operations team, you will play a pivotal role in building and leading operations and development teams dedicated to delivering high-availability AWS services, including EC2, S3, Dynamo, Lambda, and Bedrock, exclusively for EU customers. For more information on ESC please check out our blog: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-european-sovereign-cloud/\n\nKey job responsibilities\n\nYour responsibilities will encompass overseeing the launch of the ESC in 2025, working closely with global AWS teams, and influencing the evolution of AWS services and technology. A typical day in this role involves collaborating with technology leaders, contributing to the enhancement of day-to-day operations, and ensuring improvements in availability, reliability, latency, performance, and efficiency of the ESC. You will be required to occasionally participate in “on-call” rotations to resolve incidents occurring out-of-hours.\n\nThe overarching goal is to deliver scalable services and ensure a high-availability experience for EU customers. If you are an experienced professional ready for a challenging and impactful opportunity, we invite you to join our efforts in building a best-in-class development engineering and operations team that aligns with AWS' commitment to customer satisfaction and continual innovation.\n\nUtility Computing (UC)\n\nEuropean Sovereign Cloud (ESC) is a part of AWS Utility Computing (UC).\n\nAWS Utility Computing (UC) provides product innovations — from foundational services such as Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), to consistently released new product innovations that continue to set AWS’s services and features apart in the industry. As a member of the UC organization, you’ll support the development and management of Compute, Database, Storage, Internet of Things (Iot), Platform, and Productivity Apps services in AWS. Within AWS UC, Managed Operations engineers engage with AWS customers who require specialized security solutions for their cloud services.\n\nA day in the life\n\nEmbark on a week filled with meaningful contributions to the operation and improvement of significant software systems. You dedicate a substantial portion of your time to carefully review the operational health of services within your team's responsibility. In the process, you diligently identify anomalies and craft actionable bug reports, aspiring to enhance the overall efficiency and performance of your systems.\n\nIn addition to these responsibilities, you offer constructive feedback on change management documents and work earnestly to address your team's operational backlog. Through a collaborative effort, you strive to navigate challenges and ensure the seamless functionality of your systems. Additionally, you engage in the development and testing of scripts, hoping to provide practical solutions to enhance your workflows.\n\nBeyond the technical aspects, you assume a role as an educator, sharing insights on the complexities of the European Sovereign Cloud with service teams. It's a humbling experience for you to contribute to the collective knowledge of the team, fostering a culture of mutual understanding.\n\nThis week encapsulates your commitment to continuous learning and improvement, acknowledging that every effort, no matter how small, contributes to the collective success of your team and the reliability of your software systems.\n\nIn addition to these responsibilities, your position involves 24x7 on-call responsibility. You work as a team to root-cause issues and ensure your systems remain resilient and fault-tolerant, underscoring your commitment to maintaining operational excellence.\n\nEligibility requirement\n\n\n * Fluency in written and spoken English is required.\n * Successful applicants must have the legal right to work in Germany.\n * Amazon will provide relocation support for successful applicants relocating within the European Union.\n   \n   \n\nAbout The Team\n\nAbout AWS\n\nDiverse Experiences\n\nAWS values diverse experiences. Even if you do not meet all of the preferred qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply. If your career is just starting, hasn’t followed a traditional path, or includes alternative experiences, don’t let it stop you from applying.\n\nWhy AWS?\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. We pioneered cloud computing and never stopped innovating — that’s why customers from the most successful startups to Global 500 companies trust our robust suite of products and services to power their businesses.\n\nInclusive Team Culture\n\nHere at AWS, it’s in our nature to learn and be curious. Our employee-led affinity groups foster a culture of inclusion that empower us to be proud of our differences. Ongoing events and learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences, inspire us to never stop embracing our uniqueness.\n\nMentorship & Career Growth\n\nWe’re continuously raising our performance bar as we strive to become Earth’s Best Employer. That’s why you’ll find endless knowledge-sharing, mentorship and other career-advancing resources here to help you develop into a better-rounded professional.\n\nWork/Life Balance\n\nWe value work-life harmony. Achieving success at work should never come at the expense of sacrifices at home, which is why we strive for flexibility as part of our working culture. When we feel supported in the workplace and at home, there’s nothing we can’t achieve in the cloud.\n\nBasic Qualifications\n\n\n * Experience in systems engineering, working with hardware, software, networking, operating systems\n * Proficient leading the creation, revision, and/or improvement of standard operational procedures (SOPs)\n * Proficient driving operational best practices.\n * Proficient scripting processes in a language such as Bash, Python, or Ruby\n * Proficient troubleshooting and anticipating problems that affect the performance, reliability, or availability of software systems\n   \n   \n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n\n * Experience working cross-organizationally and leading strategic team efforts requiring work from multiple team members\n * Experience actively mentoring junior engineers\n * Experience performance tuning software applications and optimizing fleet utilization\n * Experience with Infrastructure as Code, (such as CDK, CloudFormation, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, or similar)\n   \n   \n\nAmazon is an equal opportunities employer.

  "description": "Description\n\nAWS is set to introduce the inaugural European Sovereign Cloud (ESC), marking a significant development in utility computing (UC). To spearhead this initiative, we are actively seeking experienced systems engineers with a strong background in automation and operations. As part of the AWS Managed Operations team, you will play a pivotal role in building and leading operations and development teams dedicated to delivering high-availability AWS services, including EC2, S3, Dynamo, Lambda, and Bedrock, exclusively for EU customers. For more information on ESC please check out our blog: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-european-sovereign-cloud/\n\nYour responsibilities will encompass overseeing the launch of the ESC in 2025, working closely with global AWS teams, and influencing the evolution of AWS services and technology. A typical day in this role involves collaborating with technology leaders, contributing to the enhancement of day-to-day operations, and ensuring improvements in availability, reliability, latency, performance, and efficiency of the ESC. You will be required to occasionally participate in “on-call” rotations to resolve incidents occurring out-of-hours.\n\nThe overarching goal is to deliver scalable services and ensure a high-availability experience for EU customers.

Through a collaborative effort, you strive to navigate challenges and ensure the seamless functionality of your systems. Additionally, you engage in the development and testing of scripts, hoping to provide practical solutions to enhance your workflows.\n\nBeyond the technical aspects, you assume a role as an educator, sharing insights on the complexities of the European Sovereign Cloud with service teams. It's a humbling experience for you to contribute to the collective knowledge of the team, fostering a culture of mutual understanding.\n\nThis week encapsulates your commitment to continuous learning and improvement, acknowledging that every effort, no matter how small, contributes to the collective success of your team and the reliability of your software systems.\n\nIn addition to these responsibilities, your position involves 24x7 on-call responsibility. You work as a team to root-cause issues and ensure your systems remain resilient and fault-tolerant, underscoring your commitment to maintaining operational excellence.\n\nEligibility requirement\n\n\n * Fluency in written and spoken English is required.\n * Successful applicants must have the legal right to work in Germany.\n * Amazon will provide relocation support for successful applicants relocating within the European Union.\n   \n   \n\nAbout The Team\n\nDiverse Experiences\n\nAWS values diverse experiences.
