Instead of traditional monetization mechanisms, Playtime builds an engaging ad experience in which users can play and earn rewards for various new mobile games in Playtime. To predict which mobile game will best suit a user, the team has introduced ML algorithms.\n\nTo build this rewarded experience, adjoe’s backend reliably handles more than 200 million users – remaining stable despite impressive growth in the user base. And imagine this: adjoe’s Golang event consumer applications assign rewards equivalent to 700 months’ of time spent in Playtime every day to its users.\n\nThe software depends on two main components.1) adjoe’s Android mobile SDK – written in a combination of Java and Kotlin – which can be bundled by developers in their apps. 2) The team’s highly scalable Golang backend, which is hosted on AWS and is otherwise responsible for developing a modern React (TypeScript) dashboard that provides adjoe’s clients and Business team colleagues with fast-loading insights.\n\nWhat You Will Do\n\n\n * Work in cross-functional teams to achieve the highest level of quality across the software development lifecycle.\n * Collaborate with adjoe’s Product Leads to develop and execute comprehensive test strategies and plans.\n * Conduct manual test cases and analyze results to ensure our SDKs, web apps, dashboards, and APIs are working correctly.\n * Play a key role in reporting and troubleshooting any bugs or errors that may occur.\n * Take ownership of post-release and post-implementation testing.\n * Propose new testing scenarios & work on increasing auto-test coverage\n * Be part of an international English-speaking team dedicated to scaling our adtech platform beyond our hundreds of millions of monthly active users.\n   \n   \n   \n\nWho You Are\n\n\n * You have 2+ years of experience as a Manual Tester or similar.\n * You are experienced in QA methodology.\n * You are familiar with Agile frameworks and regression/smoke/LIT testing.\n * You are able to document and troubleshoot errors.\n * You have a working knowledge of test management software (e.g. qTest, Cypress, Zephyr) and SQL.\n * You have hands-on experience with Automation Testing Tools (e.g. Appium, Selenium or Playwright).\n * You have excellent communication skills.\n * You pay attention to detail.\n * You have an analytical mind and problem-solving attitude.\n * You have strong organizational skills.\n * Plus: You have experience with (mobile) games QA\n   \n   \n   \n\nHave You Heard of Our Perks?\n\n\n * Work-Life Package: 2 remote days per week, 30 vacation days, 3 weeks per year of remote work, flexible working hours, dog-friendly kick-ass office in the center of the city.\n * Relocation Package: Visa & legal support, relocation bonus, reimbursement of German Classes costs, and more.\n * Happy Belly Package: Monthly company lunch, tons of free snacks and drinks, free breakfast & fresh delicious pastries every Monday\n * Physical & Mental Health Package: In-house gym with a personal trainer, various classes like Yoga with expert teachers & free of charge access to our EAP (Employee Assistance Program) to support your mental health and well-being\n * Activity Package: Regular team and company events, and hackathons.\n * Education Package: Opportunities to boost your professional development with courses and training directly connected to your career goals\n * Wealth building: virtual stock options for all our regular employees\n   \n   \n   \n\nSkip writing cover letters.

As part of our technical support team, the testing department makes sure that new features are usable and intuitive for all user groups, from new users to seasoned financial professionals.\n\n\n\n\nSince think-cell is seamlessly integrated into Microsoft PowerPoint and Excel, we have to pay close attention to think-cell's compatibility with the supported Microsoft Office products, Microsoft operating systems, and their respective updates. It's up to the testing department to review those updates, install them, and test them in detail. As a Software Tester at think-cell, you'll help improve products that over 1,000,000 professionals rely on worldwide.\n\n\n\n\nAbout this job\n\nthink-cell is constantly being developed, and you get to ensure the proper functioning of all new features. This includes not only checking for faults but also for logical consistency and intelligibility of our products. Every time we release a new version of think-cell, which we regularly do, it's up to you to perform a final release test.\n\n\n\n\nAs you cannot constantly test every single feature of think-cell, we've developed automatic test routines. It will be an important part of your job to maintain, develop, and enhance these automatic tests.\n\n\n\n\nEvery time an error occurs in our software, regardless of whether you, a customer, or a colleague found it, we require a detailed and reliable reproduction of the error to fully understand, and subsequently resolve, the problem. You'll be responsible for delivering the details we need to easily reproduce the problem on another computer. Your clarity of communication is crucial in getting the problem fixed, so strong written communication skills are a must.\n\n\n\n\nOur testing department also documents errors and everything related to them in our internal system. After the error has been resolved by our Developers, it is up to you to check if the problem has really disappeared.

Basic industrial products, such as steel, cement, chemicals, glass, and paper, form the material basis of modern societies. However, the heat demand for their production is responsible for around 20% of human CO2 emissions (or 7,5 Gt CO2 each year) due to burning fossil fuels — therefore, it is one of the last major sectors without attractive, sustainable decarbonization solutions yet.\n\nHyperheat's products will provide a complete temperature range of up to 2000°C, making it a replacement for almost every gas burner in the industry. Our solution will be more cost-effective than the fossil state of the art, contributing to a new basis for global prosperity. At the heart of the development is a durable and cost-effective electric heater that can provide industrial process heat 24/7 from PV and wind power when combined with thermal storage.\n\nHiring Process\n\n\n * Screening Interview with a team member (online call).\n * Job Interview with the hiring manager (online call).\n * Completion of a relevant take-home task to simulate actual work.\n * Homework Interview (online call).\n * Skill & Team interview with the team members (on-site at our office in Offenburg).\n * Reference check involving two provided references.\n * Decision.\n   \n   \n\nAt HyperHeat, we care deeply about inclusive working practices and diverse teams, so we particularly encourage applications from different under-represented demographics. If you'd prefer to work part-time or as a job-share, we'll facilitate this wherever we can – whether to help you meet other commitments or to help you strike a great work-life balance. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description.\n\nNote: We currently do not offer visa sponsorships, so you already need a valid work visa for the EU to apply.",
