  "description": "PROCLANE ist ein führendes Systemhaus für eCommerce, Data Integration und Beratung für digitale Prozesse. Im Geschäftsbereich PROCLANE Integration sind wir spezialisiert auf die Anbindung verschiedenster Unternehmens-Anwendungen. Du möchtest Teil unseres motivierten Entwickler-Teams in Hamburg oder Halle / Saale werden? Du suchst nach abwechslungsreichen Aufgaben und hast Lust, Verantwortung für eigene Projekte zu übernehmen? Dann freuen wir uns auf deine Bewerbung als Integration Architect SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) (w/m/d) in Voll- oder Teilzeit.\n\nWie arbeiten unsere Integration Architects CPI?\n\nUnsere Integration Architects kümmern sich bei PROCLANE Integration um das Herzstück unserer Arbeit: die Anbindung verschiedenster Systeme. Das heißt, sie konzipieren und realisieren Prozesse, die unterschiedlichste Anwendungen unserer Kunden miteinander verbinden. Wie in einem Puzzle. Eines der Puzzleteile ist häufig ein Kunden-ERP-System, welches mit weiteren Teilen (beispielsweise Onlineshop, PIM-, CRM- oder Payment-System) verbunden wird.\n\nVor der technischen Umsetzung werden sogenannte Mappings erstellt, aus denen die Übertragung der Datenfelder vom Quell- an das Zielsystem inklusive etwaiger Funktionen oder Konfigurationen ersichtlich wird. Während der Systemintegration sind unsere Integration Architects via VPN auf die jeweiligen Kundensysteme geschaltet, das heißt, sie arbeiten remote von unserem Büro aus oder auch im Homeoffice. Die technische Umsetzung findet in der Cloudumgebung von SAP statt.\n\nAber sie müssen auch immer neue Lösungen für die Anforderungen unserer Kunden finden, die mit Integrationsprojekten ihre Digitalisierungsstrategie vorantreiben. Deshalb brauchen sie ein gutes Verständnis von Prozessen und Programmierung. Und sie dürfen sich nicht scheuen, mit unseren Kunden zu sprechen, die unter Umständen auch auf Englisch. Weil wir eng an deren Systemen arbeiten, ist die direkte Abstimmung oft der einfachste Weg, um Fragen zu klären.\n\nDeine Aufgabe\n\nDu betreust eigenständig deine meist deutschsprachigen und manchmal auch internationalen Integrations-projekte und bist dabei für die Konzeption, die Kommunikation sowie die technische Umsetzung der Integrationsprozesse zuständig. Ob ein ERP-System an einen Onlineshop oder ein CRM-System angebunden wird oder eine PIM-Integration auf der Wunschliste der Kunden steht: Du kümmerst dich bis zum Live-Gang und darüber hinaus.\n\nDein Profil\n\nDas Arbeiten auf Cloud-Plattformen ist für Dich nichts Neues, idealerweise kennst Du Dich auch bereits mit der SAP Business Technology Platform und SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) aus. Du bist firm in XSLT und XPath und hast ein grundlegenes Verständnis von Web-Protokollen und -schnittstellen (HTTP, REST, SOAP). SQL, Datenbanken, XML und JSON sind für Dich keine Fremd-wörter? Perfekt! Wenn Dir dann auch noch die Arbeit im Team liegt, Du eine kunden- und ergebnisorienterte Denkweise hast und Dich Heraus-forderungen und Verantwortung reizen, bist Du bei uns absolut richtig!\n\nWarum PROCLANE?\n\nWir glauben, dass Mitarbeiter nur in flachen Hierarchien und einem offenen Miteinander ihr Potenzial voll ausschöpfen können. Zu uns passt, wer sich stetig weiterentwickeln möchte und gern über den Tellerrand schaut. Wir bieten dir flexible Arbeitszeiten, gute Weiterbildungs- und Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten, abwechslungsreiche Projekte, einen stets gefüllten Obstkorb und erfrischende Getränke. Und außerdem jede Menge Spaß bei unseren Team-Events.\n\nWann geht's los?\n\nWir suchen DICH zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt. Wenn du jetzt oder in näherer Zukunft bereit für eine neue Herausforderung bist,\n\ndann sende uns gerne deine Bewerbungsunterlagen mit frühestmöglichem Eintrittstermin und Gehaltsvorstellung per E-Mail. Wir freuen uns auf deine Bewerbung!\n\nDas bringst du mit\n\n\n * einen Hochschulabschluss im Bereich (Wirtschafts-) Informatik oder eine vergleichbare Ausbildung\n * Erste Erfahrungen mit Cloud-Plattformen, optimalerweise mit der SAP Business Technology Platform und der SAP Cloud Integration (CPI)\n * Kenntnisse in XSLT und XPath\n * Verständnis von Web-Protokollen und -Schnittstellen (HTTP, REST, SOAP) und idealerweise Kenntnisse in einer objektorientierten Programmiersprache\n * Wissen in SQL, Datenbanken, XML und JSON\n * Sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse\n   \n   \n\nWir bieten dir\n\n\n * einen sicheren Arbeitsplatz in der schönsten Stadt der Welt\n * spannende Tätigkeiten im Bereich Data Integration\n * Projektverantwortung von A bis Z: Konzeption, Kommunikation und technische Umsetzung von Prozessen sowie die dazugehörige Dokumentation\n * ein tolles Team um dich herum, das dich jederzeit gern unterstützt\n * gemeinsames Mittagessen, erfrischende Getränke, leckeres Obst, Team-Events und Spaß bei der Arbeit",
