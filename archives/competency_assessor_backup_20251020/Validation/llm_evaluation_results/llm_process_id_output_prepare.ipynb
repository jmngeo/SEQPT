As a result ofthe transition, the system is functional and compatible with enabling, interfacing, and interoperatingsystems in the environment. It installs a verified system, together with relevant enabling systems(e.g. planning system, support system, operator training system, user training system), as defined in agreements. The transition process can be used every time the system or system elements aretransitioned from one entity or environment to another\n",
