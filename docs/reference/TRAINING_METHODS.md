## Formal Training Methods

### 1. Group Classroom Training

**Description:**
- Structured courses delivered to groups of employees
- Instructor-led sessions (in-person or virtual)
- Fixed curriculum covering competency levels progressively
- Typical duration: 2-5 days per module

**When to Use:**
- Majority of role members need training (>60%)
- Competency gaps are similar across the group
- Building common understanding across teams
- Low to medium maturity organizations

**Examples from SE-QPT Strategies:**
- "Common Basic Understanding" (awareness module)
- "SE for Managers" (management-focused)
- "Orientation in Pilot Project" (project-based learning)

**Pros:**
- Cost-effective for large groups
- Builds team cohesion and shared vocabulary
- Interactive learning (group discussions, exercises)
- Consistent content delivery

**Cons:**
- One-size-fits-all approach
- May be too slow for advanced learners
- May be too fast for struggling learners
- Requires scheduling coordination

**Cost:** Low per participant (for large groups)

---

## Informal Training Methods

### 5. Mentoring and Coaching

**Description:**
- One-on-one or small group guidance
- Experienced SE practitioner mentors less experienced
- Ongoing relationship over weeks/months
- Focused on specific competency gaps or challenges

**When to Use:**
- Individual outliers (1-2 people need training, rest don't)
- Competency gaps are diverse/unique per person
- Need personalized development path
- Have internal experts available

**Mentioned in:** Ulf's comment - "If only 1 person has gap, consider mentoring"

**Pros:**
- Highly personalized
- Flexible scheduling
- Builds relationships across the organization
- Low cost (internal resource allocation)

**Cons:**
- Not scalable to large groups
- Relies on mentor availability and skill
- Quality varies by mentor
- Time-intensive for mentor

**Cost:** Low (internal time allocation)

---

### 6. Training on the Job / Learning by Doing

**Description:**
- Competency development through actual work assignments
- Structured work experiences with defined learning objectives
- Regular check-ins and feedback
- Progressive responsibility over time

**When to Use:**
- Competencies are already at foundational level (not level 0)
- Need application-level practice (level 4)
- Work assignments provide good learning opportunities
- Have supervisors who can provide guidance

**Mentioned in:** Ulf's comment - "Common basic understanding achieved through training on the job"

**Pros:**
- No direct training costs
- Learning is immediately applicable
- Natural competency development
- Productive work + learning combined

**Cons:**
- Takes longer than formal training
- Inconsistent quality (depends on assignments)

## Selection Criteria

### When to Use Which Method?

**Decision Factors:**

1. **Number of People with Gap:**
   - 1-3 people → Certification, mentoring, self-study
   - 4-10 people → Small group training, blended approach
   - 10+ people → Group classroom training, e-learning

2. **Competency Gap Severity:**
   - Level 0 (no knowledge) → Formal training, e-learning
   - Level 1-2 (awareness) → Mentoring, self-study, training on the job
   - Level 4 (application) → Project-based, training on the job
   - Level 6 (mastery) → Train the trainer, external certification

3. **Distribution Pattern:**
   - Uniform (all similar) → Group training
   - Bimodal (2 clusters) → Split into two groups
   - Outliers (1-2 different) → Individual methods for outliers

4. **Organizational Maturity:**
   - Low maturity → Standard group training, external certification
   - High maturity → Customized training, continuous support, project-based

5. **Budget Constraints:**
   - Low budget → Self-study, training on the job, mentoring
   - Medium budget → Group training, blended approach
   - High budget → Customized training, certification, train the trainer

6. **Time Constraints:**
   - Urgent (weeks) → Intensive group training, external courses
   - Medium (months) → Blended approach, project-based
   - Long-term (years) → Continuous support, train the trainer

7. **Competency Type:**
   - Technical (e.g., Requirements, Verification) → Hands-on, project-based
   - Conceptual (e.g., Systems Thinking, Holistic Thinking) → Classroom, e-learning
   - Interpersonal (e.g., Communication, Leadership) → Mentoring, practice

## Mapping to Distribution Scenarios

### Scenario 1: All at Level 0 (Complete Beginners)

**Pattern:** 100% need training

**Recommended Method:** Group classroom training
- Most cost-effective
- Everyone learns together
- Builds shared foundation

---

### Scenario 2: All at Level 4 (Experts)

**Pattern:** 0% need training

**Recommended Method:** No training needed
- May want: Communities of practice (maintain skills)
- May want: Mastery development (level 6) for select individuals

---

### Scenario 3: 90% Beginners, 10% Experts (1-2 experts in group of 10-20)

**Pattern:** Large majority needs training

**Recommended Method:** Group training with experts as mentors
- Experts attend as facilitators/helpers
- Experts benefit from reinforcing their knowledge by teaching
- Cost-effective for large group

---

### Scenario 4: 10% Beginners, 90% Experts (1-2 beginners in group of 10-20)

**Pattern:** Small minority needs training

**Recommended Method:** Individual approach for beginners
- External certification
- Mentoring by the experts
- Self-study with support
- Training on the job

**Rationale:** Not cost-effective to train entire group for 1-2 people

---

### Scenario 5: Bimodal Distribution (50% at level 0, 50% at level 6)

**Pattern:** Two distinct groups

**Recommended Method:** Split into two groups
- Group A (beginners): Group training at levels 1-2
- Group B (experts): No training OR advanced training (mastery level)
- Do NOT combine - pace mismatch will frustrate both groups

---

### Scenario 6: Uniform Distribution (Equal numbers at each level)

**Pattern:** Wide spread, no clustering

**Recommended Method:** Blended/flexible approach
- Offer multiple parallel tracks at different levels
- Self-paced e-learning with optional support
- Mentoring pairs (match beginners with experts)

**Rationale:** Too diverse for one-size-fits-all

---

### Scenario 7: Median Level 4, but High Variance

**Pattern:** Median suggests no training, but distribution is wide

**Example:** 25% at level 0, 25% at level 2, 25% at level 4, 25% at level 6

**Recommended Method:** Median alone is misleading - need segmented approach
- Analyze sub-groups
- Offer differentiated training options
- Consider: "Everyone attends, but different learning objectives per sub-group"

---

### Scenario 8: Tight Cluster Around Median

**Pattern:** Low variance (most people very close to median)

**Example:** 80% between level 3-5, median = 4

**Recommended Method:** Trust the median
- If median shows gap → Group training appropriate
- If median shows no gap → No training needed
- Outliers can be addressed individually

**Rationale:** Median is reliable when distribution is tight

---

## Recommendations for Implementation

### Phase 2 (Current):
- Focus on identifying gap and competency level
- Provide learning objectives
- **Implicit training method:** Based on selected strategy

### Phase 3 (Future):
- Analyze distribution patterns
- Recommend specific training method per competency
- Show: "Recommended: Group training (15/20 need this competency)"
- Or: "Recommended: Individual coaching (2/20 need this competency)"

### Algorithm Enhancement:
```
FOR each competency:
    gap_count = count(users with gap)
    total_count = count(all users in role)
    gap_percentage = gap_count / total_count

    IF gap_percentage > 0.7:
        recommend = "Group training"
    ELSE IF gap_percentage > 0.3:
        recommend = "Mixed approach (group + individual)"
    ELSE IF gap_percentage > 0:
        recommend = "Individual coaching or self-study"
    ELSE:
        recommend = "No training needed"
```
