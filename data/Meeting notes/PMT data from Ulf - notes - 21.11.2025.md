PMT data from Ulf - notes:



* The OneDrive folder 3 files: Contain mainly **"Method"** description, also a bit of how the methods are done using a **"Tool"**.
* The CQMS Confidential file: Focusses mostly on **"Process"** aspect. Here, recreate this pdf to remove confidential info. Rephrase the info - take info like the Chapter structures. Delete all info where it specifies things like - use this standard, or form, etc. So, take the 4 chapters and remove all and everything that seem confidential and company specific. After I have such a neutral list, then I can use AI to paraphrase it to create a finalized file that can serve as an example reference file to check out a **Process** defining document. (Create me the verification Process for my company, etc.. - similar to the Test Roles docs I created. - Maybe Ulf's talking about creating variations of Process files I can use for testing, idk.).
* After I have processed these PMT docs, I can upload these to our app for the purpose of letting the user see reference templates of PMT docs. This can help them understand the type of PMT files we need from them to process  PMT input in our app.
