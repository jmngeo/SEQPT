**PMT** input collection technique:

Instead of typing in the inputs for PMT, How the user can upload a file containing these PMT descriptions and extracting the data from it using AI - and this leads to the following learning objectives. (How to upload a document or multiple documents and extracting info using AI)

The learning objectives are correlated on the competencies, and the competencies are correlated to Processes and Tasks. - There has to be a mapping from saying that these are the competency activities - this is what the activities are the ISO - mapping these are the link to it.

Ulf can provide some template materials of such PMT describing docs of organizations. - to use this an example of process description to upload and derive from that the learning objectives.


==Implementation side vs the Conceptual side==  - I've done the implementation solely based on the conceptual side - it's like saying - we need to know which processes are already there, Which methods are already there, which tools are already there. - these are the informations we need.
We have an overview in the conceptboard as the conceptual side. Now, how we gather this information from the implementation side - it could look totally different.  Because on the implementation side, we say we could do this with AI and so on and just collecting data from the person who is like providing pdfs or somthing similar.

The Same topic of Implementation side vs the conceptual side in the RACI chart in Phase 1 role-process matrix. Thinking like - this is the information we conceptually need, but how do we get it?
We will not ask them to determine the info but rather we will use the existing documentation or if it's non existent, then you can fill it manually.
