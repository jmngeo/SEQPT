Discussion about using **Median** as the aggregation technique for each competency:

In the competency assessments, If 1 person has lowest competency value, and the rest 9 people have high competency values - then we will say we will need the high competency. Here, 1 person has a big gap while the others dont have a big gap.

A weakness of the whole training competency topic - If 1 person can already do everything but the other 9 people can't, then atleast everyone needs to get the basics training, while the 1 person has the basics already and can appear as an expert in this competency in the training.

When thinking the other way around, when everyones an expert beside one person, then we say that for that one person - you have to do that by your own to get to the same level as others.

This means that we have to change the strategy or consider if we have the right strategy in that case. This means reinforcing or rechecking the selected strategy.

(My understanding here - I'm sttill lacking clarity. we have to think of everybody's training needs. We can't just go with a training strategy that suits the majority of users. And how do we reconsider strategy.)
