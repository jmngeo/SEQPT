Ulf asks if we need the mapping from like-> this is the competency and this is the strategy. (what I've implemented). He says it's not necessary to have this structuring structure. He says it might be sensible to have an overview about the competency. Let's say a **competency based modules for qualification**. - for instance, let's say that there's a gap in the (competency) within the whole company from this level. -  Ulf's thinking if we need to split up this kind of analysis in more detail. - To analyze first of all, where is the gap in understanding. What he means about competency based qualification modules is, we say we have here - our first module is like Awareness module - Awareness means like the lowest level. 

There is the clustering regarding the competency levels - 1,2,4, and 6. - The **PYRAMID**. Would it be sensible to have this pyramid and to define them for each level. He thinks "Knowing" is the lowest one and if we click on that, then you have to get an overview - these are the learning objectives you need for "Knowing" - these are the competency gaps we have identified - and these are the roles that should be participating in "Knowing" analysis.
Then also the possibility to do take - now we have the second module "Understanding" requirements for example, and then again see who needs to have that level - The roles - what is their actual status -from those roles maybe. - To have something like this kind of overview. - Which Roles has a gap where and what are the like - and the correlated to that always the learning objectives that you present there. - This field will get more complex again.

Jomon: "About the pyramid and the levels in it - so these are the strategy's target levels. is that correct?" Ulf says the target levels could be right. - So this is what you typically aim for with this strategy. So, if you aim for "Applying" - then ... adjust? the following strategies you could use.

Jomon: "For every strategy the user has selected, should we show such a pyramid?" Ulf says no.
So what can we show this pyramid? We could show this pyramid for 1 role - and he needs to Know these things - to Understand these things - to Apply these things -and to Master these things.
So each role has such pyraminds. - But Ulf's not sure if this is something we need.
Let's think about it again. - We have the data - so we could create one view saying alright we can select a role and say alright - please show me for this role the competency profile. - this is like a shell overview of what he should know - so this is like further steps.


What is the best way to visualize - to give an overview of like - these are the learning objectives that you should focus on and so on. - The best structuring would be starting on this kind of pyramid view - if there are learning objectives on the lowest level - then we say that we have here identified the following learning objectives and we have derived from these learning objectives. So this is like you would have like, let's say a course that sets Knowing Systems Engineering. And for this course, knowing systems engineering, we would assume that you have the following learning objectives, though no consideration of roles here. Maybe of course, consideration of is this necessary? Because if it's like not necessary because this level has been achieved already. Then, it's like it should be Grayed out and say - you have already this kind of You don't need to consider it. So you start at directly level 2, but that is how I would say, this is how I think. This is a good way to structure this and then have an overview of  - these are competencies, as you know, we have derived following learning objectives for each of the competencies. 

Jomon: "So what I understand is for each of the levels in the Pyramid, we should show what competencies belong to each of these levels for the selected training strategies. Is that correct?" 
It's a good question - what we have is we have a gap, right? ==**We have a gap per role, and we have a gap in general**.== So, we now focus not on the role itself anymore for the moment, we focus on a gap in general. Let's say alright, this is to gap general. So we have seen some roles. We don't know which one or we don't tell you yet, say there is a gap. To be able to achieve this gap, there might be certain steps, so the biggest gap would be - You have to be on the highest level, but you are on the lowest, right? You will not be able to get there by one step. So maybe it would make sense to first start on the topic of Knowing then getting to this topic of Understanding, then getting to Applying, and then going to the highest level. 

So, we would assume alright for that purpose - We separate our learning objectives because we have at different times different learning objectives, so we say based on the gap, we would say -
Based on the gap you need to know the following 3 competencies - you need to focus on the Knowing. - Because of our data we have identified, there is a gap, certain roles that needs to be considered on that level. Then, we could also enter the roles on the side and say - the following roles should visit this training based on the competency assessment.

Jomon - So um, this would be when we go into more detail when you say that these are the following roles that have this gap and needs to be trained. So in each of these roles, there are users, the real users of the app. A user can belong to, or there can be multiple users in a role, so do we need to go deep into the user level? Or we should just stick to the role level?

I would say, so if a if a person has like different roles. Yeah, I would say we can stay on a Role level because we will not say this person needs training, we will say the following roless are expected in the training.

And then so for the lowest level, then we go to the and say all right, these are like this is the competencies where you have a gap. So we recommend the following learning objectives based on the input you gave us. Seeing the learning objectives, and then saying And then also adding like we should we assume that the following role should be part of this training. 

Then, we go with we go the next step. So in the Pyramid, one level higher and we go to understanding and have the same there, we say, all right, from understanding point of view, you have gaps here and there, the most people have gaps there, so we assume the following learning objectives and so on and so on. 

Jomon - So one doubt that I have when you described this is in this Pyramid - can one competency be shown in the different levels of this pyramid the same competency can appear, for example, one competency system's thinking - the current user level is 0, but the target strategy level is 3 So we have 3 gaps, and so for each of the 3 gaps for this Systems thinking competency should be described in the Knowing in the level one. We should show the level one learning objective for systems engineering and in level 2.  Again, we should show the same systems Thinking competency and show the level 2 of the competency that the users need to achieve as well. So my question essentially means if one competency can be spanned across the different levels of the Pyramid, rather than being in one?

Yes, it can. in your example, like if you have level 0 and you want to achieve level 3, then, there will be different levels be defined that shall be used as a as a recommendation, of course. So I would start with that, we could make it more complex later on as well. Because we, of course, can summarize and cluster certain things, but I would stick with that like kind of logic for the moment. 

So actually it's quite simple. It just came in my mind, so you will provide the app, and say you will provide the process method and tools descriptions. Based on these descriptions, you will get a big Dataset with learning objectives and so on. - which is clustered in competencies on one path and levels on the others. 

Right? So this will be this logic, we will have for each competency - We will have The certain numbers of Learning objectives for level 1, 2,4 and 6. And you could create that view to say show me everything where we're just like at the first level or show me everything which is in the second level or we could also have a view in saying, show me everything that's correlated and there'll be learning objectives that we have for Requirements engineering. 

So it's, it's actually just a simple filtering. 

Wait a second. So this is like the big data set, and then we will eliminate every entry where we identify it's not necessary because the competency is already there. 

So that is, let's say this from the concept or from the steps -things that happened in simply the way and one way to visualize that is then using this. For example, the Pyramid here and maybe then selecting like Understanding and then you see like everything that is as Understanding, or you could also have a grid where you see all the competencies, then you can select the competency and you see all the Like the for this one competency, the different levels that are It shall be considered.

Jomon-  So currently what I have done is so if the current value is 0 and the target is 4, we only generate the learning objective for level 4, but instead we should generate for all the gap levels until 4 is what we need. 
Correct, yeah, that's correct. Yeah, we need. We need like not just 4. We need the others as well. 


Jomon, maybe one thing what I would like you to do is Can you do some ==**research**== on that question? So to find some evidence I would assume that it is like if you If you have the lowest level or if you not have the lowest level, you first have to achieve the lowest level before you can go ahead. 
So that is, this is like the first thing And the second thing is, then is it recommended or senseful to Like bring this all in one session. So instead of like because I have a feeling, it makes more sense to start with a little awareness then to continue with Understanding and then continue with Applying it by itself, instead of directly jumping into Applying. 
So I think this is totally normal learning that we before we can apply it, we have to understand how it works. 
That's why what I said is like, maybe you find some evidence for your writing part. For that, let's call it a theory - Because with that in mind, we could argue, and that's why we will create learning objectives for each step instead of just focusing on the highest point. 


Jomon - The other dimension to all of this is the strategies that we select. If we only have one strategy and we have only one set of strategy Target levels for each competency - This process would be easier, but when we select more than one strategy - And we are doing this process for all the strategies so we have different strategy target levels. So in that case, would we have a different Pyramid for each of the strategies or Is it one? 

No, no. No I would say like, this is like a little bit independent from strategies. Okay, uh, because because I mean, because In that path where we are at the moment is like the high maturity path and there are actually just 2 strategies possible. 

So if you are in that path that this, this is the result will look like this. If we are in a different path, I would say this the Pyramid will also look the same. The only difference is, there are no roles correlated to it. And there will be no like Tailoring to it. Tailoring means regarding the processes of the company.  It would just like the standard.

But one last thought about that is in that case, I would assume that the tool topic - So everything every like um Hey, not a 100% sure if that's correct. We should think about that, but I think the tool topic will be eliminated like the low level topics because from my perspective it does not make sense to take a look at a tool if you don't have a tool that is like it's that necessary. 
So you just focus on processes and method.


Jomon - So the the one extreme case would be, we show the recommended strategies in Phase One, but the user has the ability to go and choose multiple different strategies rather than sticking with the strategies that the system recommends. - So when you talked about high maturity path, we only have 2 strategies. One of the 2 strategies that the system would recommend and the user would go with it, but the user has the ability  - the Admin in phase one to choose more than one recommended strategy or more than one strategy other than the recommended. So then there we would have multiple strategies in the learning objectives process that we need to take into account For the high maturity. 

Ulf - maybe you're right, because I mean, you could argument that based on the result you realize all right, we have processes, but no one knows them. And Then, it could make sense to also focus on like another strategy. But is it something that will happen really? 

I mean If you come to the point that you say For example, let's say you see right there are like processes, we have processes, yes, but they are not rolled out yet, which means no one is applying them, and they are not. And we don't have any system thinking, then we will probably not be part - You will not get into the high maturity part. You will stay in the low maturity part. So I would say from that, we have eliminated that risk from that perspective. And if you are the high maturity part and you recommend to the point that it's like our people know nothing - then we'll lead to Our maturity has been was wrong. Because, if no one like is doing systems engineering or is applying system thinking, but you have said Systems Thinking is something that is well aware in our company.  - There is a logical error. 

So I would say then it could like, we, in that situation There could there could be some mechanism that says right here there's a gap between the maturity and the competencies you have. Then maybe adjusting to recommend - Maybe you should think about Re-evaluating your maturity. 

But I would I would for now - So for further progress, Um, why is this the strategy actually necessary? Because saying will I do company specific things - like integrating the data and the process and so on. and Define learning objectives on that base, Or am I am in low maturity and I will just use let's say general learning objectives. 

Jomon - So this is taking into account the competency assessment results and seeing if the results depict a different scenario than a high maturity organization. 

Ulf - So, one last talk about that - So if you are on the and the high maturity path Then, we would do it, as we have discussed. So like having this competency assessment, comparing this with the actual and just show, like for each level, what learning objectives are recommended. 

From the other part, if you have a low level path, I would say - Here we focus on the selected strategy and provide like - You have selected this strategy - So we will assume the following learning objectives because of strategy, ==which is just until level 2==, not higher. 

But only in the low, I would have this kind of what you have showed before - The separation between the strategies only the low level path and not on the high level path. 

Jomon - So earlier, I had the understanding that we just need to look at the gap and generate the learning objective for that gap. So It's different now, I understand. 

Ulf - Yes, it's so it's it's a good question actually, so I would I would say, so for now, I would start with like - we do not know the gap yet. 

So we assume like we need everything from that strategy, - so like these are the learning objectives. And then we Let's say eliminate those things where there is no gap - And maybe maybe like making it greyed out. and say it this means there is no gap. - So there is no need for action here. This competency does not need to be considered - It's learning objectives. 

And show them anyway, because it could be a good nice information for The persons who are using it. But um, No, nothing more. 

#### My current algorithm's logic explanation:

Jomon - So um. Should I explain what we only have like what I've created for the strategy validation Currently, that I have implemented?
So for the current implementation, what I've done is we have this validation Check - If the selected strategies Makes sense according to the results of the competency assessment. 

How that validation happens is, it's a process that I thought of and implemented right now. So yeah, is there something that I wanted to check with you as well - So ==train the trainer== is one of the exceptional strategies. where all the values are high. The mastery level. 
I think this strategy has to be kept different, shown differently from the rest of the strategies. 
And we should not take this strategy into our validation. Whether the strategies are suiting the current status. So, for example, in here So it's a expert development.

Ulf - yes, so I would, as I said, this kind of Train the trainer - We can we can like really separate this from the whole process, because this will be like - We would see where we at is. 
We will at the beginning or at the very end, we will ask. So do you want to have to implement this with internal trainers or with external trainers? And based on that, we would come into that strategy as well.

Jomon - Yeah, it should be treated separately. Got it. 
So in this example case, there are 3 strategies selected in total. We have, I know that this strategy selection doesn't make a lot of sense. We have a high strategy, high maturity strategy - continuous support and SE for managers, then, train the trainer. These are the 3 strategies in this example case. Um, so train the trainer would be treated separately and we are comparing our current competency assessment data whether the selected 2 strategies - continues support and the SE for Managers are good enough for the training. So this validation process is explained at  top here, so what we do is we first collect the input data - The assessment data. 
So for each of the or for all the users, we get the values for each of the competencies. Then, we also have the competency values for each role from the role competency matrix data. So that would be the role requirement value.
Then, we would have the strategy target levels from the selected strategies. So these are the 3 input data. 
And then we start with the validation process. Is this clear so far to you? 

Ulf - can you repeat the information that all the information that you're going to use for the validation process? I was not a 100% sure. 

Jomon - So for the high maturity organization, we have our role competency matrix - from this we have the required competency values for each role. So that would be the role requirement value for each role for each competency. 
Yeah, that is one input. And the second input we have 3 such inputs. The second input is the user's competency assessment results data. 
And the third one would be the target levels for each strategy that the user has selected. Yeah, so we have these 3 values, and we are using these 3 values to determine if the selected strategies are suitable.  

Ulf - Why do we need? just the understanding question? I would say the like, let's say the competence gap, And the target value of the strategies that would make, so this two would actually make sense. But I will think give me a second. 

Jomon - So We do the the 3-way comparison. We have the comparison of the user's current value with their role requirement value. So that is one comparison. 
The other comparison is comparison of the current value ...

Ulf - All right, okay, so it's not the gap you use. It's like the you calculate the gap and then you use it to map - Is the gap suitable to the okay? 

So then but we have to answer the question. So if the value is higher, the gap is so we identify right from the gap is low, which means the value is high and you have selected something where we only aim at a low level, we will say, this is not the right strategy. So the other way around - If the value is very low and we will say we aim for a very high competency level based on the gap we have is then the recommendation is fine? This actually should be right.?

Jomon - if the strategy target is high And if the current competency value is low, then the selected strategy should be valid is my understanding. 

Ulf - That makes sense for me as well.

Then the next is the last question -
We have earlier discussed about something else. Which needs to be considered if strategy is right. Which would be - if the results came to low - For example, in system thinking And everywhere else as well - There could be so if it's like, really low Would we then -
Oh, no, that would be the question would be then assume that you say - All right, you should change your strategy. Because we think the maturity of the company on systems engineering is not the same of your employees is not the same as you have suggested. 

Is it a valid thing We could ask or indicate on that, or could we simply say - from an organizational perspective, so you defined processes But actually, on the process side we could argument that, but the other side we would assume if you have, if you say, all right, we have system thinking is already well explained or well Established, and you come to the point that no one is. - When it comes to the system thinking no one says he has a high maturity or high compotency there, then it might be sensible to say, all right, this is not - You should double-check your strategy. 

If there could one argument or we could also say all right, it's fine stick with their strategy - But you should consider like more steps to get to the highest level. More steps in terms of your first need to get Applying - And I've first said, did you get understanding then applying? And at the very end, the topic of Uh, mastery. 

Yeah, so I would say in that case. So we are not considering this. We will only consider the validation - If the archetype is lower than the actual competency level, we should say - Reconsider your strategy, the other way around- We would say go ahead. It seems to be fine. I would say it's it's fine enough to do that way. 


Jomon - So here again, when we talk about the competencies, suppose maybe 1 or 2 or a minority of the competencies have this problem, but the rest of the competencies or the rest of the target values for the competencies seem good enough for the current assessment data. So we should stick with the current strategy. - Ulf says it's correct. 

Jomon - So for example here we would see how much the gap severity is for each of the strategies and if the severity is high for more than majority. Or we define a threshold, and if it goes about that, then we would recommend a different strategy to be selected. 


Ulf - But one thing, what does not make sense is to have to separate between the strategy between the competencies. Because a strategy will apply for all competencies. 

So I think this overview (my Cross-coverage table) is not like that necessary that you have created here. Because It looks a little bit that you say, for a Systems Thinking you should use this strategy. But for the other competencies, you should use another one which is like not the right result or not. What we are Aiming at as an overview, it's more like as is said - The value is low, so let's say everyone they said we want to use common understanding, but everyone can already or most of them can already apply system engineering in most of the path. Then its like common understanding might be not the right thing to do here.
