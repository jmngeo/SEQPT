4. PROCEDURE
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1.1 User Inputs are qualitative in nature and are captured in the User Input
      Document (UID), also known as User Requirements. The intended use of the
      product, including the needs of the user, the needs of the customer, the
      use environment, safety (from Risk Management), and compliance
      requirements, shall be established and documented in the UID. The UID
      contains the requirements against which the design is validated.

4.1.2 Qualitative information from the UID (User Input, Compliance Requirements,
      and Safety Requirements) is used as the basis for developing quantifiable
      Engineering Inputs (Product Requirements, Component Requirements). The
      Engineering Inputs are the requirements that Design Outputs are verified
      against.

4.1.3 Design Inputs shall be documented so that each requirement satisfies
      these properties:

      a) Clear, Concise and Unambiguous: All requirements shall be precisely
         stated, eliminating room for more than one interpretation.

      b) Non-Conflicting: All requirements, or any subset thereof, shall not
         make contradictory statements.

      c) Measurable: Design Inputs must be capable of being verified and/or
         validated. All Inputs shall be verifiable or validatable in an
         unambiguous manner.

      d) Complete: Requirements must be developed to a sufficient extent to
         describe the physical and performance characteristics.

4.1.4 Design Inputs will be revised and updated to reflect continued inputs
      from complementary design activities (e.g., changes due to ongoing risk
      management activities).

4.1.5 The requirements development process may be iterative and continue
      through the completion of Design Outputs prior to verification. Design
      Input documents shall be reviewed, approved, and revision controlled.

4.1.6 Requirements documents may be revised and updated as needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 SOURCES FOR DESIGN INPUTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.1 Source materials for Design Inputs might include:

      - Market studies including user profiles, use scenarios, use environment,
        and distribution areas (e.g., Market and Customer Needs Document)
      - Business Requirements
      - Initial Risk Analysis (Preliminary Hazard Analysis)
      - Complaints, incident reporting, and adverse events
      - User considerations (e.g., operational workflow)
      - Regulatory statutes
      - Technical considerations
      - External consensus standards
      - Current or previous product Design Inputs

4.2.2 Generally, User Inputs (User Requirements) are "external" inputs since
      they are based on customer needs, external standards, and control
      measures from Risk Management.

4.2.3 Engineering Inputs (Product Requirements, Component Requirements) are
      "internal" inputs since they are based on the internal decisions of the
      project team on how to meet the user inputs and address standards and
      control measures from Risk Management.

      NOTE: Platform development projects (developing reusable components and
      modules across different target systems) may have both external and
      internal inputs addressing all target components. These inputs can be
      collected in a dedicated document (e.g., Platform Stakeholder Needs) or
      may be segregated into separate documents.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 USER INPUT DOCUMENT (UID) PROCESS - USER REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3.1 The process of developing Design Inputs shall start with a review of:

      - Prior to Design Control activities, Marketing/Product Management
        typically leads an effort to understand user needs associated with a
        new product or feature. These are documented in a customer needs
        document and translated into requirements in the UID.

      - Regulatory/Compliance will inform engineering of currently applicable
        regulations and consensus standards. This information shall be
        documented as compliance requirements in the UID.

      - A Preliminary Hazard Analysis or Risk Analysis shall be completed prior
        to the approval of Design Inputs. This information shall be used as
        input to the safety requirements in the UID.

4.3.2 The design output will be validated against the User Inputs.

4.3.3 User Inputs shall include but are not limited to:

      a) Intended use of the product
      b) Use environment and target user group (environmental conditions,
         storage, operations, expected shelf life, expected usage)
      c) Human Factors, Usability Engineering process interface characteristics
      d) Safety requirements derived from Preliminary Hazard Analysis/Risk
         Analysis
      e) Quality compliance requirements (applicable standards, regulations)

4.3.4 Additional User Input might include:

      a) Top-level characteristics (weight, color, portability, etc.)
      b) Compatibility, interface, and interchangeability requirements
      c) Geographic distribution and language requirements
      d) Labeling claims
      e) User regulatory requirements
      f) Legal requirements
      g) Performance characteristics
      h) Functional characteristics
      i) Planned user training requirements
      j) Service requirements

4.3.5 A review shall be conducted to ensure User Inputs are clear, complete,
      unambiguous, non-conflicting, and validatable. Issues when identified
      shall be resolved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4 ENGINEERING INPUT DOCUMENT (EID) PROCESS - PRODUCT/COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4.1 Based on the User Input Document, prepare quantifiable Engineering Inputs
      with appropriate engineering detail to guide a successful design effort.
      These shall be unambiguous to facilitate clear design verification
      testing.

      NOTE: Business requirements as well as external standards and control
      measures from Risk Management (if quantitative) can be addressed directly
      in the Engineering Input Document.

4.4.2 Engineering requirements shall include but are not limited to:

      a) Performance requirements
      b) Mechanical requirements (including packaging/shipping and interfaces)
      c) Electrical requirements (including interfaces)
      d) Software requirements
      e) Material requirements (structural, dimensional, compatibility)
      f) Product life and reliability
      g) Safety requirements from Risk Management Process
      h) Labeling requirements
      i) Regulatory requirements (product and industry standards)

4.4.3 Additional Engineering Input might include:

      a) Manufacturability
      b) Interface requirements (between systems, subsystems, components)
      c) Chemical requirements
      d) Environmental requirements (storage, operating, disposal)
      e) Formal user training, certification, and re-certification programs

      NOTE: Engineering requirements can be produced at System, Product, or
      Component level. For complex products, it is recommended to produce
      Product Requirements, then prepare a Product Architectural Design. Once
      components are identified, prepare Component Requirements.

4.4.4 Engineering requirements may be contained in one document or segregated
      into separate documents (Software Requirements Specification, Mechanical
      Design Input, etc.).

4.4.5 Each User Input in the UID shall trace to at least one Engineering Input
      in the EID.

4.4.6 Engineering Inputs shall trace up to at least one User Input where
      appropriate. Some software-specific inputs may be derived from sub-system
      or system-level engineering requirements.

4.4.7 Engineering Inputs might be directly traced to quantitative safety
      requirements from risk analysis and applicable standards.

4.4.8 Engineering Inputs for software should be based on the Software Life
      Cycle Process.

4.4.9 Engineering requirements shall include user interface, mechanical
      interface, electrical interface, performance requirements, alarm
      messages, connectivity requirements, safety requirements, and planned
      user training.

4.4.10 A review shall be conducted to ensure Design Inputs are clear, complete,
       unambiguous, non-conflicting, and verifiable. Issues shall be resolved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5 REQUIREMENTS TAG NUMBERING (TRACEABILITY)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5.1 A requirement tagging system will be used to establish traceability. Each
      input (User or Engineering) must have a unique tag number assigned.

4.5.2 Recommended tagging convention:

      - User Inputs: Begin with "U" or "UR" (e.g., U001, UR-001)
      - Engineering Inputs:
        - Product Requirements: "E" or "PR" (e.g., E001, PR-001)
        - Component Requirements: "CR" (e.g., CR-001)

      Example traceability: U123 -> E123.1, E123.2, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.6 APPROVAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.6.1 The UID and EID shall be approved according to the organization's Design
      Control Document Approval Matrix.
