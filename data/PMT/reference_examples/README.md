# PMT Reference Examples

This folder contains example documents that demonstrate what Process, Method, and Tool (PMT) documentation looks like in a Systems Engineering context.

## Purpose

These examples help users understand:
1. **What type of documents to upload** to the SE-QPT tool
2. **The difference between Process, Method, and Tool** documentation
3. **The level of detail expected** in each document type

## Available Examples

| File | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `EXAMPLE_PROCESS_Design_Input_SOP.txt` | **PROCESS** | Standard Operating Procedure for design requirements workflow |
| `EXAMPLE_METHOD_System_Context_Modeling.txt` | **METHOD** | Technical guide for system context modeling technique |
| `EXAMPLE_TOOL_Requirements_Management_Tool.txt` | **TOOL** | User guide for a requirements management software |

## PMT Classification Guide

### PROCESS Documents
- **Focus**: WHO does WHAT and WHEN
- **Contains**: Roles, responsibilities, approval workflows, review gates
- **Examples**: SOPs, work instructions, RACI matrices, quality procedures
- **Key Question**: "What organizational steps must we follow?"

### METHOD Documents
- **Focus**: HOW to perform a technical activity
- **Contains**: Concepts, techniques, diagrams, step-by-step procedures
- **Examples**: Modeling guides, analysis techniques, design methods
- **Key Question**: "How do I technically accomplish this task?"

### TOOL Documents
- **Focus**: HOW to use specific software
- **Contains**: Screenshots, menus, button clicks, shortcuts
- **Examples**: User guides, quick references, tutorials
- **Key Question**: "How do I use this software to do my work?"

## Quick Identification Tips

| Look For... | Indicates... |
|-------------|--------------|
| Approval signatures, revision history | PROCESS |
| Roles and responsibilities matrix | PROCESS |
| Conceptual diagrams, technique explanation | METHOD |
| Best practices, when to apply | METHOD |
| Software screenshots, menu paths | TOOL |
| Keyboard shortcuts, troubleshooting | TOOL |

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Review the examples** to understand the structure and content of each type
2. **Identify your organization's documents** that match these categories
3. **Upload your documents** to SE-QPT for automated PMT extraction
4. **Review the extracted PMT values** and refine as needed

## Note

These are simplified, generic examples. Real organizational documents may:
- Combine multiple PMT aspects in one document
- Have industry-specific terminology
- Follow company-specific formatting

The SE-QPT tool's AI extraction will handle these variations and classify content appropriately.
