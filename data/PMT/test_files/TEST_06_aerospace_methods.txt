# Systems Engineering Methods for Aerospace Programs
## Technical Practices Handbook

### 1. Requirements Engineering Methods

#### 1.1 Stakeholder Analysis
Identify and categorize stakeholders using the onion model:
- Core stakeholders (operators, maintainers)
- Direct stakeholders (customers, suppliers)
- Indirect stakeholders (regulators, public)

Conduct stakeholder interviews and workshops to elicit needs.

#### 1.2 Requirements Elicitation Techniques
- Structured interviews with prepared questionnaires
- Joint Application Development (JAD) workshops
- Scenario-based elicitation using mission threads
- Prototyping for user interface requirements
- Analysis of regulations (DO-178C, DO-254, ARP4754A)

#### 1.3 Requirements Analysis Methods
- Functional decomposition using IDEF0
- Quality Function Deployment (QFD) for prioritization
- Requirements parsing for testability assessment
- N-squared (N2) diagrams for interface analysis

#### 1.4 Requirements Verification Methods
- Inspection (document review)
- Analysis (mathematical proof, simulation)
- Demonstration (operational scenarios)
- Test (controlled experiments)

### 2. Architecture Development Methods

#### 2.1 Functional Architecture
Method: FFBD (Functional Flow Block Diagrams)
- Decompose top-level functions
- Define functional interfaces
- Allocate performance requirements
- Timeline analysis for time-critical functions

#### 2.2 Physical Architecture
Method: Trade Study Process
1. Define evaluation criteria and weights
2. Identify candidate architectures
3. Assess against criteria (Pugh matrix)
4. Sensitivity analysis
5. Document decision rationale

#### 2.3 Interface Definition
- Interface Control Documents (ICDs)
- Interface Requirements Matrix
- Physical interface drawings
- Data dictionary for data interfaces

### 3. Verification and Validation Methods

#### 3.1 Test Planning
- Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP)
- Developmental test planning
- Operational test planning
- Test case derivation from requirements

#### 3.2 Analysis Methods
- Worst-case analysis (electrical, thermal)
- Reliability prediction (MIL-HDBK-217)
- Maintainability analysis
- Safety analysis (FTA, FMECA, ZSA)

#### 3.3 Simulation Methods
- Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty
- Hardware-in-the-loop simulation
- Operational mission simulation
- Environmental simulation (thermal, vibration)

### 4. Configuration Management Methods

#### 4.1 Configuration Identification
- Configuration Item (CI) selection criteria
- Part numbering scheme
- Baseline establishment

#### 4.2 Configuration Control
- Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) process
- Configuration Control Board (CCB) operation
- Impact assessment methodology

#### 4.3 Configuration Status Accounting
- As-designed vs as-built tracking
- Serial number effectivity
- Configuration audit procedures

### 5. Risk Management Methods

#### 5.1 Risk Identification
- Risk brainstorming workshops
- Assumption analysis
- Historical data review
- Expert judgment (Delphi technique)

#### 5.2 Risk Assessment
- Probability and consequence scoring
- Risk matrix (5x5)
- Expected value calculation
- Risk prioritization

#### 5.3 Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Avoidance (change approach)
- Transfer (insurance, subcontract)
- Mitigation (reduce probability/impact)
- Acceptance (with contingency)

### 6. Technical Performance Measurement

Track key technical parameters:
- Weight tracking against budget
- Power consumption margin
- Processing throughput
- Memory utilization
- Reliability growth

TPM reporting in technical reviews with trend analysis.
