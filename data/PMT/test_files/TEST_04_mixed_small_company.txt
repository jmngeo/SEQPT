# Engineering Practices at SmallTech Solutions
## How We Build Products

### Our Development Approach

We're a small team of 12 engineers building IoT devices. Here's how we work:

**Process:**
We use a simplified Agile/Scrum process with 2-week sprints. Every Monday we have sprint planning, and Fridays are demo days. Our product owner prioritizes the backlog, and the team self-organizes to complete stories.

For hardware changes, we have a simple approval process:
1. Engineer proposes change
2. Peer review (another engineer)
3. Lead engineer approval
4. Update BOM in our system

**How We Design:**
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Quick whiteboard sketches for architecture
- Detailed design only for complex features
- Design reviews happen informally during daily standups

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests required for all new code (pytest)
- Integration tests run nightly
- Manual testing before releases
- Beta testing with select customers

### Tools We Use

**Development:**
- VS Code for coding (Python, C++)
- PlatformIO for embedded development
- GitHub for source control and CI/CD

**Hardware:**
- KiCad for PCB design
- FreeCAD for enclosure modeling

**Project Management:**
- Notion for documentation and wikis
- Linear for issue tracking
- Slack for communication

**Testing:**
- pytest for Python unit tests
- Google Test for C++ code
- Postman for API testing

### Quality Standards

We're ISO 9001 certified and follow basic quality practices:
- Code reviews for all pull requests
- Automated linting (pylint, clang-format)
- Monthly retrospectives to improve
