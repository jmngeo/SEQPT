# Agile Development Practices
## Scrum and Kanban Implementation Guide

### 1. Scrum Framework

We implement Scrum with the following ceremonies and artifacts:

**Sprint Cadence:** 2 weeks

**Ceremonies:**
- Sprint Planning (Monday morning, 2 hours)
- Daily Standup (every day 9:15 AM, 15 minutes)
- Sprint Review (last Friday, 1 hour)
- Sprint Retrospective (last Friday after review, 1 hour)
- Backlog Refinement (Wednesday, 1 hour)

**Roles:**
- Product Owner: Sarah (owns backlog prioritization)
- Scrum Master: Mike (facilitates ceremonies, removes impediments)
- Development Team: 6 engineers (cross-functional)

**Artifacts:**
- Product Backlog (prioritized list of features)
- Sprint Backlog (committed work for sprint)
- Increment (working software at sprint end)

### 2. User Story Format

As a [user type],
I want [goal],
So that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Written in Given-When-Then format
- Testable and specific
- Reviewed by QA before sprint planning

**Definition of Ready:**
- Story estimated (story points)
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Dependencies identified
- UX designs available (if needed)

**Definition of Done:**
- Code complete and reviewed
- Unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- Integration tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Deployed to staging
- Product Owner accepted

### 3. Estimation Practices

**Planning Poker:**
- Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Reference story for calibration
- Discussion for divergent estimates

**Velocity Tracking:**
- Average of last 3 sprints
- Used for sprint capacity planning
- Tracked in Jira dashboard

### 4. Kanban Practices

For maintenance and support work:

**Board Columns:**
- Backlog
- Ready
- In Progress (WIP limit: 3)
- Code Review (WIP limit: 2)
- Testing
- Done

**Policies:**
- Pull from right to left
- WIP limits enforced
- Blocked items flagged immediately
- Daily review of aging items

### 5. Technical Practices

**Pair Programming:**
- Required for complex features
- Driver/Navigator rotation every 30 min
- Remote pairing via VS Code Live Share

**Code Review:**
- All code reviewed before merge
- Max 400 lines per review
- Review within 24 hours

**Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
- Write test first
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Focus on behavior, not implementation

**Continuous Integration:**
- Commit at least daily
- Build must pass before merge
- Automated deployment to dev environment

### 6. Tools

**Project Management:**
- Jira Software (Scrum/Kanban boards)
- Confluence (documentation)

**Communication:**
- Slack (team channels, standups)
- Zoom (remote ceremonies)
- Miro (remote retrospectives, planning)

**Development:**
- GitHub (source control)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- VS Code (IDE)

### 7. Metrics We Track

- Sprint Velocity (story points completed)
- Sprint Burndown (daily progress)
- Cycle Time (idea to production)
- Defect Escape Rate (bugs found in prod)
- Team Happiness (retrospective surveys)
