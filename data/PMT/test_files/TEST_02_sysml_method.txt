# SysML Modeling Guidelines
## Technical Method Description for Model-Based Systems Engineering

### 1. Introduction

This document describes the SysML modeling methodology used in our organization for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). SysML (Systems Modeling Language) is a general-purpose graphical modeling language that supports specification, analysis, design, and verification of complex systems.

### 2. Diagram Types and Usage

#### 2.1 Requirements Diagram (REQ)
Purpose: Capture and organize textual requirements with traceability
When to use: At project start, during requirements elicitation
Key elements: Requirement blocks, derive, satisfy, verify relationships

#### 2.2 Block Definition Diagram (BDD)
Purpose: Define system structure and composition
When to use: During architecture definition
Key elements: Blocks, parts, references, value properties, operations

#### 2.3 Internal Block Diagram (IBD)
Purpose: Show internal structure and connections between parts
When to use: For interface definition and data flow analysis
Key elements: Parts, ports, connectors, item flows

#### 2.4 Activity Diagram (ACT)
Purpose: Model behavior and workflows
When to use: For functional analysis and use case realization
Key elements: Actions, control flows, object flows, swimlanes

#### 2.5 State Machine Diagram (STM)
Purpose: Model discrete behavior with states and transitions
When to use: For mode analysis and control logic
Key elements: States, transitions, triggers, guards, effects

### 3. Modeling Best Practices

3.1 Naming Conventions
- Use CamelCase for block names
- Use lowercase with underscores for properties
- Prefix interfaces with "I_"
- Use verb phrases for operations

3.2 Stereotypes
Apply appropriate stereotypes from our custom profile:
- <<system>> for top-level systems
- <<subsystem>> for decomposed elements
- <<interface>> for external boundaries
- <<requirement>> with priority attribute

3.3 Traceability Rules
- Every requirement shall satisfy at least one stakeholder need
- Every function shall be allocated to at least one block
- Every test case shall verify at least one requirement

### 4. Model Organization

Package Structure:
```
Project Model
├── 01_Stakeholder_Needs
├── 02_Requirements
│   ├── Functional_Requirements
│   ├── Performance_Requirements
│   └── Interface_Requirements
├── 03_Architecture
│   ├── System_Context
│   ├── Logical_Architecture
│   └── Physical_Architecture
├── 04_Behavior
└── 05_Verification
```

### 5. Review Criteria

Model reviews shall check:
- Completeness of traceability links
- Consistency between diagrams
- Adherence to naming conventions
- Proper use of stereotypes
- Model simulation results where applicable
