## Recommended Reading Order

### For Understanding the System:
1. Start with **Executive Summary** (10 minutes)
2. Review **Visual Flowcharts** (15 minutes)
3. Deep dive into **Detailed Technical Explanation** (30 minutes)

### For Reviewing Specific Aspects:
- **Logic Flow**: Focus on Visual Flowcharts
- **Algorithm Details**: See Technical Explanation sections 3-4
- **Decision Making**: Review Technical Explanation section 5
- **Example**: See Technical Explanation section 6

---

## Key Concepts Summary

### 1. Two Pathways
- **Task-Based**: For organizations without defined roles (2-way comparison)
- **Role-Based**: For organizations with defined roles (3-way comparison)

### 2. Aggregation Method
- Always use **MEDIAN** for current competency levels
- Why: Returns valid levels, robust to outliers

### 3. Decision Thresholds
- **>60% users** need more → Recommend new strategy
- **20-60% users** need more → Add supplements
- **<20% users** need more → Note for future

### 4. Output
- ONE unified training plan per organization
- Not separate plans per role
- Includes recommendations and future pipeline

### 5. Data Requirements
- Minimum 70% employee completion rate
- Only uses latest assessment per employee
- Requires Phase 1 completion first

## Critical Design Principles

1. **Statistical Validity**: Median aggregation, minimum data requirements
2. **Organizational Evolution**: Task-based orgs evolve to role-based
3. **Practical Implementation**: One plan, clear objectives, actionable output
4. **Future Planning**: Tracks gaps for next iteration

---

## Questions These Documents Answer

✅ How does the algorithm determine which pathway to use?
✅ Why use median instead of average?
✅ How are multiple roles handled?
✅ What happens when strategies don't meet all needs?
✅ How does the system handle organizations without roles?
✅ What's the difference between 2-way and 3-way comparison?
✅ How are strategic recommendations generated?
✅ Why generate one plan instead of multiple?
✅ How does the system ensure data quality?
✅ What are the edge cases and how are they handled?

---

## For Algorithm Validation

The algorithm has been designed with:
- **Deterministic logic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Clear decision boundaries**: Explicit thresholds and rules
- **Robust aggregation**: Handles outliers and missing data
- **Scalability**: Works for 10 or 1000 employees
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to both organizational types

---

## Contact for Questions

If any aspect needs clarification after reviewing these documents, the specific areas that might need discussion are:
1. The rationale for 60% and 20% thresholds
2. Alternative aggregation methods considered
3. Handling of core competencies that can't be directly trained
4. The evolution path from task-based to role-based organizations
