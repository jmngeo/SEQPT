## **SCORING AND VALIDATION ALGORITHMS**

### **Maturity Assessment Scoring:**
```
Scope Score (S) = Σ(i=1 to 15) [Question_Score_i × Weight_i × 4] / Σ(i=1 to 15) Weight_i
Process Score (P) = Σ(j=16 to 33) [Question_Score_j × Weight_j × 5] / Σ(j=16 to 33) Weight_j
Overall_Maturity = √[(S² + P²) / 2]
```

### **Competency Scoring:**
```
Individual_Competency_Score = Selected_Group_Level (1-4, or 0 if Group 5 selected)
Role_Gap_Analysis = Required_Level - Current_Level
Priority_Score = Gap × Competency_Weight
```

### **Validation Rules:**
- Completeness: All required fields completed
- Consistency: Cross-reference validation between related questions
- Logic checks: Answer combinations make logical sense
- Range validation: Numerical inputs within expected ranges
