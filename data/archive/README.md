## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Old questionnaire versions** - Current versions exist and are actively used
2. **Development instructions** - Phase 1 is complete; instructions are now historical
3. **Old documentation** - Superseded by current documentation

## When to Reference These Files

- **Understanding project history** - See how the system evolved
- **Debugging legacy issues** - If old behavior needs to be investigated
- **Academic documentation** - For thesis writing about the development process
