  Description: The purpose of the disposal process is to end the existence of a system element or system for aspecified intended use, appropriately handle replaced or retired elements, appropriately handle anywaste products, and to properly attend to identified critical disposal needs (e.g. per an agreement; perorganizational policy; or for environmental, legal, safety, or security aspects).This process deactivates, disassembles, and removes the system or any of its system elements from thespecific use. It addresses any waste products, consigning them to a final condition and returning theenvironment to its original or an acceptable condition. The waste products can be in-process resultingduring any life cycle stage, e.g. waste materials during fabrication. This process destroys, stores, orreclaims system elements and waste products in an environmentally sound manner, in accordance withlegislation, agreements, organizational constraints and stakeholder requirements. Disposal includespreventing expired, non-reusable, or inadequate elements from getting back into the supply chain.Where required, it maintains records in order that the health of operators and users, and the safety ofthe environment, can be monitored. When part of the system will continue to be in use in a modifiedform, the disposal process helps ensure the proper handling of the portion being disposed of.
