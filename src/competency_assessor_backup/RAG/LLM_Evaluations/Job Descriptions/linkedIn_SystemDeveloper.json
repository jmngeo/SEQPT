With freedom to heavily influence our choice of tooling.\n\n\n\n\nWho You Are\n\n * Pragmatic Developer: Understand coding best practices and know when to apply and especially also when NOT to apply them optimal results.\n * Technical Proficiency: Several years experience in building scalable production systems using Python, Docker, Redis, and MongoDB. Familiarity with Hugging Face models, phone systems and audio data is a plus.\n * Algorithmic Creativity: You have the experience and creativity to build and test new algorithms and architectures.\n * Startup Experience: Proven track record of working in a fast-paced, dynamic startup environment or similar (e.g. VC or freelance)\n * Based in Europe: Eligible to work remotely in Europe, no matter if you are in Germany, France, Spain or in any other European country.\n * Experienced with production workflows: Proficient in pull requests, code reviews, CI/CD services, deployments, and collaborative development.\n * Data Savvy: Experienced in building scalable data pipelines with a focus on performance and latency.\n * Business Minded: Ability to understand and translate business requirements into technical solutions.\n * Excellent Communicator: Strong interpersonal skills with the ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n * Frontend Skills: Experience with React or other modern frontend frameworks to help us improve our frontend\n * Business Background: Prior experience in business roles that enhances understanding of customer needs.\n * Machine Learning Interest: While not required, an interest or basic knowledge in ML can be beneficial.\n * Audio Data & Phone System Experience: Having worked with μ-law data, knowing audio compression\n * Language Skills: Our product works across many languages, so being a polyglot would help in testing\n\n\n\n\nWhy join us?\n\n * High Impact Role: Significant ownership and the opportunity to shape the product and company direction.\n * Flexible Remote Work: Fully remote startup with the freedom to work from anywhere in Europe and flexible working hours with a monthly remote work budget for co-working or equipment.\n * Personal Growth Budget: Annual allowance for conferences, courses, books, or subscriptions to foster your professional development.\n * Exciting Team Offsites: Regular strategy meetings in fantastic locations across Europe.\n * Performance-Based Bonus: Monthly bonuses in addition to your salary, rewarding your contributions and achievements.\n * Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP): Opportunity to own a part of the company after having proven your impact\n\nWho we are\n\nWe are Tim, Allegro & Jérôme.

Our team members work from wherever they choose to live and we regularly get together in nice locations all over Europe for fun and a bit of work. Please note that we meet somewhere in Europe, so you should be within reasonable flight time from major European cities.\n\nWe work in small teams, focused on shipping products in 4-6 week cycles.\n\nWe always strive to improve ourselves and the way we work, so we like to experiment with new tools and new ways of working. Sometimes it works out, sometimes we fail, but we always learn a lot during the process.\n\nWe are highly result-oriented and are looking for people who are too.\n\nYou take on full responsibility for your projects and its results. In return, we give you a lot of freedom and independence to shape your daily work.\n\nWe strongly believe in transparency, so we share (almost) every information within the company and even open source it in our handbook.\n\nWe discuss issues openly and directly with each other and bring them up as soon as we notice them.\n\nWe highly value the opinions of our team members and make decisions based on data, not hierarchy. Your voice counts, but you might not be right every time. 😉\n\nTasks\n\nOur Projects\n\n\n * Modern web apps (ReactJS, Angular)\n * FireBase integrations (Auth, Database, Hosting)\n * REST API integration\n   \n   \n   \n\nTech Stack We Use\n\n\n * ReactJS\n * Angular\n * Django REST Framework\n * TypeScript\n * REST API\n * PostgreSQL\n * Firebase\n * Sentry\n * Github\n * Codeship – CI/CD\n   \n   \n   \n\nRequirements\n\nWe are looking for an experienced developer, meaning you spent at least 55 productive months coding on commercial projects AND you have a long list of solutions which did not work (and you learned a lot from them).\n\nYou have to be experienced with 80% of our tech stack, also ReactJS is a must (2+ years). We know everyone is willing and capable to learn fast, but see first point.\n\nExcellent English skills are crucial for this position. You need to be able to explain technical solutions to non developers. And more importantly, tell funny jokes and have a good time with us. 😉",
