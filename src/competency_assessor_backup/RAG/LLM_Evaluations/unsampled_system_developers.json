On the one hand, you will be involved in ongoing projects, on the other hand will have the chance to be independently responsible for new projects, all the while staying in direct contact with our clients. Within the project team, you will take over the analysis and technical evaluation of complex customer requirements in the automotive area (e.g. Power Electronics), derive specific product requirements (usually corresponding with A-SPICE), and actively support the technical department with the generation of new requirements (UX-perspective) and the evaluation of their potential effects. The participation in various technical alignments is as much part of your daily job as the presentation of new requirements withing the framework of Change Control Boards, and the preparation of decision templates. Ultimately, you are responsible for guaranteeing the reliability and validity of the requirements.\n\nYour Profile\n\nBesides your finished high school education with a technical background (Electrical Engineering, Mechatronics, Vehicle Technology, Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, Business Information Technology etc.), we are looking for individuals with a customer focus and strong communication skills.

You\u00b4re at home within a technical environment, you want to include your knowledge in our projects, and you are able to present that knowledge on every level of business hierarchy, including to people with a non-technical background. Ideally, you have already gained experience in Requirements Engineering and Automotive Requirements Process (e.g. A-SPICE, ASIL) and are familiar with software development processes, testing processes, but also with IBM Rational DOORS, IBM Rational Synergy, CANape and EXAM. Initial experiences in the development of steering systems are an advantage.\n\nOur offer\n\nWe offer a position within a professional team which has years of experience in the industry. Flat hierarchies and communication on equal terms are self-evident, as well as a good salary. On top of that, you will get the opportunity to grow your skills and yourself while working on interdisciplinary projects (We offer advanced trainings regularly).

Dann freuen wir uns auf deine Bewerbung als Integration Architect SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) (w\/m\/d) in Voll- oder Teilzeit.\n\nWie arbeiten unsere Integration Architects CPI?\n\nUnsere Integration Architects k\u00fcmmern sich bei PROCLANE Integration um das Herzst\u00fcck unserer Arbeit: die Anbindung verschiedenster Systeme. Das hei\u00dft, sie konzipieren und realisieren Prozesse, die unterschiedlichste Anwendungen unserer Kunden miteinander verbinden. Wie in einem Puzzle. Eines der Puzzleteile ist h\u00e4ufig ein Kunden-ERP-System, welches mit weiteren Teilen (beispielsweise Onlineshop, PIM-, CRM- oder Payment-System) verbunden wird.\n\nVor der technischen Umsetzung werden sogenannte Mappings erstellt, aus denen die \u00dcbertragung der Datenfelder vom Quell- an das Zielsystem inklusive etwaiger Funktionen oder Konfigurationen ersichtlich wird. W\u00e4hrend der Systemintegration sind unsere Integration Architects via VPN auf die jeweiligen Kundensysteme geschaltet, das hei\u00dft, sie arbeiten remote von unserem B\u00fcro aus oder auch im Homeoffice. Die technische Umsetzung findet in der Cloudumgebung von SAP statt.\n\nAber sie m\u00fcssen auch immer neue L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die Anforderungen unserer Kunden finden, die mit Integrationsprojekten ihre Digitalisierungsstrategie vorantreiben. Deshalb brauchen sie ein gutes Verst\u00e4ndnis von Prozessen und Programmierung. Und sie d\u00fcrfen sich nicht scheuen, mit unseren Kunden zu sprechen, die unter Umst\u00e4nden auch auf Englisch. Weil wir eng an deren Systemen arbeiten, ist die direkte Abstimmung oft der einfachste Weg, um Fragen zu kl\u00e4ren.\n\nDeine Aufgabe\n\nDu betreust eigenst\u00e4ndig deine meist deutschsprachigen und manchmal auch internationalen Integrations-projekte und bist dabei f\u00fcr die Konzeption, die Kommunikation sowie die technische Umsetzung der Integrationsprozesse zust\u00e4ndig. Ob ein ERP-System an einen Onlineshop oder ein CRM-System angebunden wird oder eine PIM-Integration auf der Wunschliste der Kunden steht: Du k\u00fcmmerst dich bis zum Live-Gang und dar\u00fcber hinaus.\n\nDein Profil\n\nDas Arbeiten auf Cloud-Plattformen ist f\u00fcr Dich nichts Neues, idealerweise kennst Du Dich auch bereits mit der SAP Business Technology Platform und SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) aus. Du bist firm in XSLT und XPath und hast ein grundlegenes Verst\u00e4ndnis von Web-Protokollen und -schnittstellen (HTTP, REST, SOAP). SQL, Datenbanken, XML und JSON sind f\u00fcr Dich keine Fremd-w\u00f6rter? Perfekt!

Industrielle Grundprodukte wie Stahl, Zement, Chemikalien, Glas und Papier bilden die materielle Grundlage moderner Gesellschaften. Der W\u00e4rmebedarf f\u00fcr ihre Herstellung ist jedoch f\u00fcr etwa 20 % der menschlichen CO2-Emissionen (oder 7,5 Gt CO2 pro Jahr) verantwortlich, die durch die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe entstehen - daher ist dies einer der letzten gro\u00dfen Sektoren, f\u00fcr den es noch keine attraktiven, nachhaltigen Dekarbonisierungsl\u00f6sungen gibt.\n\nDie Produkte von Hyperheat werden den kompletten ben\u00f6tigten Temperaturbereich bis 2000\u00b0C abdecken und damit fast jeden Gasbrenner in der Industrie ersetzen. Unsere L\u00f6sung wird kosteng\u00fcnstiger sein als der fossile Stand der Technik und zu einer neuen Grundlage f\u00fcr den globalen Wohlstand beitragen. Im Mittelpunkt der Entwicklung steht ein langlebiger und kosteng\u00fcnstiges elektrisches Heizsystem, der ggf. in Verbindung mit Speichern rund um die Uhr industrielle Prozessw\u00e4rme aus ann\u00e4hernd CO2 freien Wasser-, PV- und\/oder Windstrom liefern kann.\n\nEinstellungsprozess\n\n\n * Vorstellungsgespr\u00e4ch mit einem Teammitglied (Online).\n * Vorstellungsgespr\u00e4ch mit dem einstellenden Manager (Online).\n * Kleine Hausaufgabe, um die tats\u00e4chliche Arbeit zu simulieren.\n * Hausaufgaben-Interview (Online).\n * Skill & Team Interview mit den Teammitgliedern (vor Ort in unserem B\u00fcro in Offenburg).\n * Referenzpr\u00fcfung mit zwei zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellten Referenzen.\n * Entscheidung.\n   \n   \n\nBei HyperHeat legen wir gro\u00dfen Wert auf integrative Arbeitspraktiken und vielf\u00e4ltige Teams, weshalb wir Bewerbungen von verschiedenen, unterrepr\u00e4sentierten Bev\u00f6lkerungsgruppen besonders f\u00f6rdern.
