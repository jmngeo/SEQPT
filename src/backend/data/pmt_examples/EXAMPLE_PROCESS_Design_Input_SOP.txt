================================================================================
1. PURPOSE
================================================================================

This procedure establishes the workflow for creating and managing Design Inputs
(requirements) for new products and product changes. It ensures requirements are:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Traceable from user needs to technical specifications
- Reviewed and approved before implementation

================================================================================
2. SCOPE
================================================================================

This procedure applies to all product development projects within the organization
that require formal requirements documentation and design control.

================================================================================

4. PROCEDURE
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements are developed in two levels:

USER REQUIREMENTS: High-level, qualitative needs from the customer/user
perspective. These describe WHAT the product must do and are used for
VALIDATION (does the product meet user needs?).

ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS: Detailed, quantitative specifications that engineers
use to design the product. These describe HOW to meet user requirements and
are used for VERIFICATION (does the design meet specifications?).

All requirements must be:
a) Clear and unambiguous - only one interpretation possible
b) Non-conflicting - no contradictions between requirements
c) Measurable - can be verified or validated objectively
d) Complete - sufficient detail for design and testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 REQUIREMENT SOURCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input sources for requirements include:
- Market research and customer feedback
- Business objectives and strategy
- Preliminary risk analysis results
- Regulatory requirements and standards
- Lessons learned from previous products
- Technical feasibility studies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 USER REQUIREMENTS PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Gather Inputs
  - Product Management provides customer needs documentation
  - Regulatory identifies applicable standards and regulations
  - Risk team provides preliminary hazard analysis

Step 2: Document User Requirements
  - Create User Requirements Document (URD)
  - Include: intended use, user environment, safety needs, compliance needs
  - Each requirement gets a unique identifier (e.g., UR-001)

Step 3: Review and Approve
  - Cross-functional team reviews for completeness
  - Resolve any ambiguities or conflicts
  - Obtain formal approval per approval matrix

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4 ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Derive from User Requirements
  - Translate qualitative user needs into quantitative specifications
  - Add technical details needed for design

Step 2: Document Engineering Requirements
  - Create Engineering Requirements Document (ERD)
  - Include: performance specs, interface specs, safety specs
  - Each requirement gets a unique identifier (e.g., ER-001)

Step 3: Establish Traceability
  - Link each engineering requirement to parent user requirement(s)
  - Document rationale for derived requirements

Step 4: Review and Approve
  - Technical review for feasibility and testability
  - Obtain formal approval per approval matrix

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5 TRACEABILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements Identification System:
  - User Requirements: UR-XXX (e.g., UR-001, UR-002)
  - Engineering Requirements: ER-XXX (e.g., ER-001, ER-002)

Traceability Requirements:
  - Every User Requirement must trace to at least one Engineering Requirement
  - Every Engineering Requirement must trace to at least one User Requirement
  - Maintain traceability matrix throughout the project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.6 APPROVAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements documents are approved according to the organization's Document
Control procedure. Typical approvers include:
  - Project Manager
  - Engineering Lead
  - Quality Assurance
  - Regulatory (for regulated products)

================================================================================
5. RELATED DOCUMENTS
================================================================================

- Risk Management Procedure
- Design Control Procedure
- Document Control Procedure
- User Requirements Template
- Engineering Requirements Template
- Traceability Matrix Template

================================================================================
KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS PROCESS DOCUMENT
================================================================================

This document demonstrates typical PROCESS elements:

1. WORKFLOW FOCUS: Describes step-by-step activities
2. ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES: Defines who does what
3. APPROVAL GATES: Specifies review and sign-off points
4. TRACEABILITY: Establishes how items link together
5. REFERENCES: Points to related procedures and templates

PROCESS documents answer: "What must our organization do, in what order,
and who is responsible?"

This is different from:
- METHOD documents (which explain HOW to perform technical activities)
- TOOL documents (which explain HOW to use specific software)
