1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

The System Context Model is a fundamental systems engineering artifact that
establishes what is INSIDE the system being developed versus what is OUTSIDE
(the environment). This boundary definition is critical for:

- Scoping the development effort
- Identifying external interfaces
- Understanding environmental constraints
- Defining what the system must interact with

This method applies to any engineered system - hardware, software, or
integrated systems.

================================================================================
2. METHOD OVERVIEW
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 OBJECTIVE AND PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The System Context Model provides:

1. A clear definition of system scope
2. Identification of all external actors and systems
3. Documentation of all external interfaces
4. Definition of information, energy, and material flows

Deliverables:
- System Context Diagram
- Interface Definition Table
- External Actor Descriptions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 WHEN TO APPLY THIS METHOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apply system context modeling:
- At the beginning of system development (requirements phase)
- When scope changes significantly
- When integrating with new external systems
- During system architecture reviews

Prerequisites:
- Initial stakeholder needs identified
- High-level system purpose defined
- Key external systems known

================================================================================
3. KEY CONCEPTS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 SYSTEM OF INTEREST (SoI)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The System of Interest is the system being developed or analyzed. In the
context diagram, it appears as a single block representing the entire system
scope.

Characteristics:
- Everything inside this boundary is "in scope" for development
- The internal structure is not shown (black box view)
- Only external interfaces are visible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 EXTERNAL ACTORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

External Actors are entities outside the system boundary that interact with
the System of Interest. Types include:

Human Actors:
- Operators (primary users)
- Maintenance personnel
- Administrators

External Systems:
- Connected software systems
- Hardware interfaces
- Network infrastructure

Environmental Factors:
- Physical environment
- Regulatory environment
- Business constraints

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 SYSTEM BOUNDARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The system boundary separates:
- What is DEVELOPED (inside) vs. what EXISTS (outside)
- What is CONTROLLED vs. what is ACCEPTED as-is
- Development responsibility vs. integration dependency

Boundary decisions affect:
- Project scope and cost
- Risk allocation
- Interface complexity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 INTERFACES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interfaces define HOW the system interacts with external actors:

Interface Types:
- Data interfaces (information exchange)
- Control interfaces (commands, signals)
- Physical interfaces (mechanical connections)
- Energy interfaces (power, thermal)
- Material interfaces (consumables, products)

================================================================================
4. MODELING ELEMENTS
================================================================================

When using SysML or similar notations, the following elements are used:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 BLOCKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Represent system elements and external actors
Notation: Rectangle with name compartment
Usage: One block for SoI, one block for each external actor

Example:
  +-------------------+
  | Vehicle Control   |
  | System            |  <-- System of Interest
  +-------------------+

  +-------------------+
  | Driver            |  <-- External Actor
  +-------------------+

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 PORTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Define connection points on blocks
Types:
- Flow ports (for continuous flows)
- Standard ports (for discrete interactions)

Example:
  [Block]--o  <-- Port symbol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 INTERFACES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Define the contract for what passes through ports
Contains:
- Data types
- Signal definitions
- Protocol specifications

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4 FLOWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Show what moves between system and actors
Types:
- Information flows (data, commands)
- Energy flows (electrical, thermal)
- Material flows (physical items)

Notation: Arrows connecting ports

================================================================================
5. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE
================================================================================

STEP 1: Define the System of Interest
  - Name the system being developed
  - Write a brief purpose statement
  - Clarify what is IN vs. OUT of scope

STEP 2: Identify External Actors
  - List all humans who interact with the system
  - List all external systems that connect to it
  - List environmental factors that affect it
  - For each actor, describe their role and interest

STEP 3: Define Interfaces
  - For each external actor, identify all interaction points
  - Determine what flows in each direction
  - Classify flows by type (data, control, physical, energy)
  - Document interface requirements

STEP 4: Create the Context Diagram
  - Place SoI in the center
  - Arrange external actors around the SoI
  - Draw connections showing interfaces
  - Label all flows with names and directions

STEP 5: Validate the Model
  - Review with stakeholders
  - Check for missing actors or interfaces
  - Verify boundary decisions are correct
  - Document assumptions and decisions

================================================================================
6. BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

DO:
- Keep the SoI as a single "black box" - don't show internal details
- Include ALL external actors, even if interfaces seem simple
- Document the rationale for boundary decisions
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Review with stakeholders early

DON'T:
- Mix context view with internal architecture
- Forget passive actors (environment, regulations)
- Skip documentation of interface details
- Assume everyone agrees on the boundary

Common Pitfalls:
- Scope creep: unclear boundaries lead to expanding scope
- Missing actors: forgetting maintenance, administration, or compliance
- Over-detailing: adding internal structure too early

================================================================================
7. EXAMPLE APPLICATION
================================================================================

Example: Smart Home Thermostat System

System of Interest: Smart Thermostat Control System

External Actors:
1. Homeowner (Human)
   - Adjusts temperature settings
   - Views energy usage reports
   - Receives alerts

2. HVAC System (External System)
   - Receives on/off commands
   - Reports status

3. Mobile App (External System)
   - Sends remote commands
   - Receives status updates

4. Weather Service (External System)
   - Provides forecast data
   - Provides current conditions

5. Power Grid (Environment)
   - Supplies electrical power
   - May send demand response signals

Interfaces Identified:
- User Interface: touchscreen, voice commands
- HVAC Control: relay signals, status sensors
- Network: WiFi connection to cloud services
- Power: 24V AC from HVAC transformer
