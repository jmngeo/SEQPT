Der Wärmebedarf für ihre Herstellung ist jedoch für etwa 20 % der menschlichen CO2-Emissionen (oder 7,5 Gt CO2 pro Jahr) verantwortlich, die durch die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe entstehen - daher ist dies einer der letzten großen Sektoren, für den es noch keine attraktiven, nachhaltigen Dekarbonisierungslösungen gibt.\n\nDie Produkte von Hyperheat werden den kompletten benötigten Temperaturbereich bis 2000°C abdecken und damit fast jeden Gasbrenner in der Industrie ersetzen. Unsere Lösung wird kostengünstiger sein als der fossile Stand der Technik und zu einer neuen Grundlage für den globalen Wohlstand beitragen. Im Mittelpunkt der Entwicklung steht ein langlebiger und kostengünstiges elektrisches Heizsystem, der ggf. in Verbindung mit Speichern rund um die Uhr industrielle Prozesswärme aus annähernd CO2 freien Wasser-, PV- und/oder Windstrom liefern kann.\n\nEinstellungsprozess\n\n\n * Vorstellungsgespräch mit einem Teammitglied (Online).\n * Vorstellungsgespräch mit dem einstellenden Manager (Online).\n * Kleine Hausaufgabe, um die tatsächliche Arbeit zu simulieren.\n * Hausaufgaben-Interview (Online).\n * Skill & Team Interview mit den Teammitgliedern (vor Ort in unserem Büro in Offenburg).\n * Referenzprüfung mit zwei zur Verfügung gestellten Referenzen.\n * Entscheidung.\n   \n   \n\nBei HyperHeat legen wir großen Wert auf integrative Arbeitspraktiken und vielfältige Teams, weshalb wir Bewerbungen von verschiedenen, unterrepräsentierten Bevölkerungsgruppen besonders fördern.
